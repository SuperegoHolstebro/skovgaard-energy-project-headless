Objective: Develop a component in isolation, to make it easy for a developer to implement within a large headless CMS project. The component should encompass all utilities, styles with Tailwind and functionality within a singular tsx file. There should be json at the top of the file that populate the text and images throughout the page so it can be easily rewired into a headless CMS at a later date.

File Naming Conventions:
• Use PascalCase for all file names.
• Correct: ⁠UserProfile.tsx, AuthLayout.tsx, ApiUtils.ts
• Incorrect: ⁠userProfile.tsx, ⁠auth-layout.tsx, ⁠apiutils.ts
• Use ⁠.tsx extension for React components.
• Use ⁠.ts extension for utility files.
• Use .⁠schema.ts extension for schema files.
• Use .⁠query.ts extension for groq files.
• Use ⁠.structure.ts extension for structure files.
• Do not use spaces or underscores or hyphens.
